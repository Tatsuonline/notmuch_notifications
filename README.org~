This is a very simple Rust program designed to check a remote mail server where notmuch is setup and provide a notification on your client computer if new mail has arrived. It also plays a small wav file as part of the notification.

To use it, do the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone thisrepo
#+END_SRC

Now, edit the src/main.rs file and change the following parts to your use case:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mail@mail-server # Your username and mail server.
/home/tatsu/Programming/notmuch_notifications/media/spock_mail.wav # The location of your chosen notification sound file.
#+END_SRC
