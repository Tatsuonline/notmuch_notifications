This is a very simple Rust program designed to check a remote mail server where notmuch is setup and provide a notification on your client computer if new mail has arrived. It also plays a small wav file as part of the notification.

To use it, first ensure you can SSH into your mail server without a password. Then do the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/Tatsuonline/notmuch_notifications.git
#+END_SRC

Now, edit the src/main.rs file and change the following parts to your use case:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mail@mail-server # Your username and mail server.
/home/tatsu/Programming/notmuch_notifications/media/spock_mail.wav # The location of your chosen notification sound file.
#+END_SRC

Build the release in the folder:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cargo build --release
#+END_SRC

The code is now ready. We can set up the cron job now to run every minute (or whatever you prefer). Note that the DISPLAY=:0 portion is necessary:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
export DISPLAY=:0 && /path/to/the/folder/notmuch_notifications/target/release/notmuch_notifications
#+END_SRC

This should produce the following notification when you receive new mail:

#+CAPTION: Screenshot of an example notification.
#+NAME: Notification screenshot.
